This intelligent software employs a variety of sensors to continuously monitor and maintain factors such as temperature, humidity, and air circulation, ensuring the ideal conditions for healthy mushroom growth.
>> This software is tailored for the Arduino Uno microcontroller platform and ensures precise environmental regulation vital for optimal mushroom growth. It features an optional OLED screen, providing users with real-time data monitoring for a user-friendly and intuitive cultivation experience.

# Installation
---

1. **Download the Arduino IDE:**
    
    [Arduino Software Download Page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
    
    Choose the version appropriate for your operating system (Windows, 
macOS, or Linux). There might be two versions available: one from the Microsoft Store (for Windows) and one from the website. Either one should work, but the website version is more common.
    
2. **Install the Arduino IDE:**

    * For **Windows**:
      * If you downloaded the installer from the website, run the installer and follow the installation wizard.
      * If you downloaded it from the Microsoft Store, simply install it like any other app.
    * For **macOS**:
      * Open the downloaded `.dmg` file.
      * Drag the Arduino application to the Applications folder.
    * For **Linux**:
      * Extract the downloaded archive to a location of your choice.
      * Navigate to the extracted directory and run the `install.sh` script.

3. **Launch the Arduino IDE:**
    
    Once the installation is complete, you can launch the Arduino IDE from your applications menu (on Windows or macOS) or by running the arduino command in your terminal (on Linux).

4. Initial Configuration:

    When you first launch the Arduino IDE, you might need to configure it to recognize your Arduino board. To do this:
    * Go to the "Tools" menu. 
    * Select "Board" and choose your specific Arduino model (e.g., Arduino Uno).
    * Under the "Port" menu, select the serial port your Arduino is connected to (if it's not automatically detected).
